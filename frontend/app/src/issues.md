<!-- File to write any issue you notice, that can be dealt furthur -->

1. If i just select a model then re-select another model ..build json will contain keys of prev model too (due to ...register execution on loading prev selected model's page i think)

2. Not notifing after a new request and after a training completed

3. if results in SVM and LandMarkSVM is not good then check by doing normalization (it is part of model or it should be in preprocessing?? )
